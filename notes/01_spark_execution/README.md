# Spark Execution  


1.  Spark Execution
    
	  * Interactive Client 
	      [Spark Shell , Notebooks]
	  * Submit Job
	      [Spark submit]
		  
2.  Spark Distributed Processing Model [Master-Slave]

      *  In Spark Terminology Master -> Driver  && Slave ->Executor

      *  Spark Engine going to ask for a container from the underline cluster manager [YARN] to start driver process 
	  
	  *  The driver is again going to ask some more containers to start the executors process. This happen for each application

3.  Spark Execution Modes
      
	  * Client Mode - [Spark Shell and Notesbooks]
	    
		  - Driver process runs locally in your client machine, However driver will still connect to YARN to start executors, and get back the results.
		  
		  - if we quit or logoff the client , driver dies inturn executors dies to

	  * Cluster Mode - Refer [2]

4.  Spark Cluster Managers And Most Common Spark Execution Models 
     
	  *  local[n]   --> [IDE]
	       -  n = no of threads

	  *   YARN
	  *   K8S
	  *   MESOS
	  *   Standalone
